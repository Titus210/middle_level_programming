## Vectors
__STL__ (Standard Template Library) <br>
This are General purpose classes And function that stores data <br>
Can be defined as library of container classes, algorithms and iterations<br>
### What is Vectors
- These are dynamic arrays used to store data, but unlike arrays they can automatically adjust the size deuring runtime.
- They are unordered
#### Time Complexity
__Insertion__ <br>
1. End: Takes differential time, because sometimes we might need  to increase space.
2. Begining and middle: Takes linear time
__Removing__ <br>
1. Last: Takes linear time as no resizing is required.
2.
