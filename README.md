##	 	Introduction
C++ is a statically typed general purpose freeform midle level language developed by [Bjane Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup#:~:text=Bjarne%20Stroustrup%20(%2F%CB%88bj,Computer%20Science%20at%20Columbia%20University.com)) in 1979.
C++ is statically typed because type check is performed during compile time as opossed to runtime.
### 	Features of C++
The main feature of C++ is Object Oriented programming which uses objects to represent real world entitywhich is set to design program using classes and objects.
The main OOP concepts are:
**Object** is an instance of a class.
**Class** is template/blueprint that describes behaviour/state that object type supports.
**Methods** are behaviour of an object 
-	**Inheritance**: The object aquires properties and behaviour of parent object which provides re-userbility and helps to achieve runtime polymorphism.
-	**Polymorphism**: Task is performed in many ways where we achieve function overloading and overiding
-	**Abstraction**: This is where we hide internal details and show the functional part of the program, using abstract class and interface achieve this feature.
-	**Encapsulation**: This is binding and wrapping code/ data to a single unit
