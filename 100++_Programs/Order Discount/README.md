## Introduction
This program is designed to prompt the user to enter the number of items ordered and the price of each item. It then calculates the total billing amount, taking into account shipping and handling fees based on the total cost of the order.
## Overview 
The program utilizes a loop to obtain the price of each item, and then calculates the total cost of the order. If the total cost is $200 or more, shipping and handling fees are waived, otherwise the cost is $10 per item. The final output is the total billing amount, taking into account any applicable shipping and handling fees.
## Challenge 
The challenge presented by this program is to accurately calculate the shipping and handling fees based on the total cost of the order, while also ensuring that the program remains simple and easy to understand.
## Algorithm
1. Prompt the user to enter the number of items ordered
2. Obtain the price of each item using a loop and accumulate the total cost of the order
3. Determine if the total cost of the order is $200 or more
4. If the total cost is $200 or more, waive the shipping and handling fees
5. If the total cost is less than $200, calculate the shipping and handling fees as $10 per item
6. Calculate the final billing amount, taking into account any applicable shipping and handling fees
7. Output the final billing amount to the user
## What was learned
Through the process of designing and implementing this program, I gained experience in working with loops, conditionals, and pointer variables. I also learned how to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable steps in order to develop an algorithm for solving it.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this program successfully addresses the challenge presented by the prompt, and provides a functional solution for calculating the total billing amount for an online purchase. By utilizing loops, conditionals, and pointers, the program is able to accurately determine any applicable shipping and handling fees, while remaining simple and easy to understand.
